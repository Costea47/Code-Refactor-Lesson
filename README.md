# Code-Refactor-Lesson

## Description
The Horiseon website has been refactored to meet accessibility standards. This project focuses on improving web accessibility, ensuring that people with disabilities can access the site using assistive technologies such as screen readers, video captions, and braille keyboards. The refactored code also aims to enhance the website's search engine optimization (SEO) for better visibility.

### Tasks Completed:

1. Semantic HTML Elements: The codebase now incorporates semantic HTML elements throughout the source code. This enhances the structure and readability of the HTML, making it more accessible and independent of styling.

2. Logical HTML Structure: HTML elements have been organized to follow a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. This improves maintainability and adherence to best practices.

3. Accessible Image and Icon Elements: Image and icon elements now include descriptive and accessible `alt` attributes. This ensures that users with visual impairments can understand the content conveyed by these elements.

4. Sequential Heading Attributes: Heading attributes have been adjusted to fall in sequential order, improving the document's outline structure and making it more user-friendly for screen readers.

5. Concise Title Elements: Title elements have been updated to provide a concise and descriptive title for the webpage. This contributes to better search engine optimization (SEO) and improves overall accessibility.

6. Functional Links: All links within the application have been reviewed and updated to ensure they function correctly. This enhances the user experience and navigation within the site.

7. Consolidated and Organized CSS: CSS selectors and properties have been consolidated and organized to follow a semantic structure. This not only improves the efficiency of the CSS but also enhances code readability and maintainability.

8. CSS File Documentation: The CSS file is now properly commented, providing clear documentation for each element or section of the page. This makes it easier for developers to understand the styling choices and customize the codebase.
